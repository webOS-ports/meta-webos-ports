# setting WEBOS_COMPONENT_VERSION and WEBOS_SUBMISSION

# Explicitly inheriting from this bbclass also implies that the component uses
# the Open webOS convention for submission tags, i.e., they are of the form:
#    submissions/<integer>
# or, when the component has been branched:
#    submissions/<integer>.<integer>
# where <integer> does not contain leading zeros. If they are different, inherit
# from webos_submissions instead.

# i.e., it includes the submission. If there is no PREFERRED_VERSION_<packagename>
# setting, '0' will be returned.

# Parse a PV in the following format:
#
#    <component-version>-<enhanced-submission>
#
# setting WEBOS_COMPONENT_VERSION and WEBOS_SUBMISSION
#
# Explicitly inheriting from this bbclass also implies that the component uses
# the Open webOS convention for submission tags, i.e., they are of the form:
#    submissions/<integer>
# or, when the component has been branched:
#    submissions/<integer>.<integer>
# where <integer> does not contain leading zeros. If they are different, inherit
# from webos_submissions instead.
#

# The component version is PV with the last hyphen-separated field removed; 
# i.e., it does not include the submission.

        # contain a hyphen
        return pv

# The submission is the first underscore-separated field in the enhanced
# submission field, which is the last hyphen-separated field in PV
# If there is no hypen in PV, '0' will be returned.

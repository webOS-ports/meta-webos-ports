# This is a sample configuration file for LuneOS ril driver
#
# This file is expected to be installed in /etc/ofono
#
# Configuration for each modem is defined in its own [ril_x] section,
# common settings are in the [Settings] section, all other sections
# are ignored.
#
# If any value from [ril_x] section (except "socket") is defined
# in the [Settings] section, it becomes the default for all modems.
# Default values can still be redefined at [ril_x] level.
#

[Settings]

# This option stops RIL plugin from creating any RIL modems.
# If it's set to true, all [ril_x] sections are ignored even
# if they are present, and no default configurtation is created.
#
# Default is false
#
#EmptyConfig=false

# User and group for the ofono process. RIL clients are typically
# expected to run under radio:radio.
#
# Default is radio:radio
#
#Identity=radio:radio

# If the phone has more than one SIM slot, the 3G/LTE module may be
# shared by all modems, meaning that only one of the slots can use
# 3G/LTE. In order to "hand 4G over" to the other slot, the modem
# currently using 3G/LTE has to drop to GSM, release 3G/LTE module
# and only then 3G/LTE can be used by the other modem. This setting
# allows to disable this behaviour (say, if your phone has independent
# 3G/LTE modules for each slot or you don't need 4G for both slots).
# Obviously, it only has any effect if you have more than one SIM.
#
# Default is true (switch the current data modem to 2G when changing
# the data modems)
#
#3GLTEHandover=true

# RIL_REQUEST_SET_RADIO_CAPABILITY may or may not be supported by your RIL.
# This option allows you to forcibly enable or disable use of this request.
# It's involved in 3G/LTE handover between the modems, meaning that it only
# makes sense if you have more than one slot.
#
# Possible values are auto, on and off
#
# Default is auto (enable for RIL version >= 11)
#
#SetRadioCapability=auto

[ril_0]

# Required entry, defines the RIL socket path
socket=/dev/socket/rild

# Subscription string. Some (mostly, older) RILs require that 4 bytes
# (usually SUB1 or SUB2) are written to the socket before rild starts
# talking to us.
#
# Not sent by default.
#
#sub=SUB1

# RIL logging prefix, to tell one socket from another in the log.
# Makes sense if you have more than one modem configured.
#
# No prefix by default.
#
#name=RIL1

# Slot id for SET_UICC_SUBSCRIPTION request.
#
# By default the first modem becomes slot 0, the next one slot 1 and so on.
#
#slot=0

# RIL request timeout, in milliseconds.
#
# The default is zero (no timeout)
#
#timeout=0

# Comma-separated list of radio technologies supported by the modem.
# Valid technologies are "gsm", "umts" and "lte". The special value
# "all" means that all technologies are supported.
#
# The default is all
#
#technologies=all

# This one is deprecated, use the technologies entry instead (above).
#
#enable4G=true

# RIL_REQUEST_SET_UICC_SUBSCRIPTION is 115 in RIL version 9 (or earlier)
# and 122 in RIL version 10 and later. Since ofono doesn't know in advance
# which RIL version it's dealing with, it makes the decision at runtime.
# Settings it to false disables the workaround and always sends 122.
#
# Default is true (select SET_UICC_SUBSCRIPTION based on the RIL version)
#
#uiccWorkaround=true

# Points to the file containing comma-separated ECC (Emergency List Codes)
# list, e.g. 911,112,*911,#911. The file is tracked by ofono and when its
# contents changes, it's reflected in the EmergencyNumbers property of
# org.ofono.VoiceCallManager.
#
# If necessary, the contents of the file can be synchronized with the
# Android system property by adding something like this to /init.rc:
#
# on property:ril.ecclist=*
#     write /var/lib/ofono/ril.ecclist ${ril.ecclist}
#     chmod 0644 /var/lib/ofono/ril.ecclist
#
#ecclistFile=/var/lib/ofono/ril.ecclist

# RIL_REQUEST_ALLOW_DATA may or may not be supported by your RIL.
# This option allows you to forcibly enable or disable use of this request.
# Possible values are auto, on and off
#
# Default is auto (enable for RIL version >= 11)
#
#allowDataReq=auto

# Since RIL interface doesn't provide the standard way of querying the
# number of pin retries left, some RIL implementation (namely Qualcomm)
# allow to query the retry count by sending the empty pin. If your RIL
# actually does check the empty pin (and decrements the retry count)
# then you should turn this feature off.
#
# Default is true
#
#emptyPinQuery=true

# Different RILs use different data call structures which don't necessarily
# match the format specified in the data list header. The header may have
# version 9 but the list may contain RIL_Data_Call_Response_v6 structures,
# list version 10 may contain RIL_Data_Call_Response_v11 and so on. By default
# ofono assumes that the version from the list header matches the contents
# but sometimes you have to explicitly tell ofono which one to use.
# Possible values are 6, 9, 11 and auto.
#
# Default is auto
#
#dataCallFormat=auto

# Data call may fail with status 65535 which according to ril.h means that
# we need to retry silently. The maximum number of retries is limited by
# this parameter. Usually, one retry is enough. The first retry occurs
# immediately, the subsequent ones after dataCallRetryDelay (see below)
#
# Default is 4
#
#dataCallRetryLimit=4

# Delay between data call retries, in milliseconds. Note that the first
# retry occurs immediately after the first failure, the delays are only
# applied if the first retry fails too.
#
# Default is 200 ms
#
#dataCallRetryDelay=200

# Additional local and remote hangup reasons. Remote reasons are checked
# first. Normally, RIL plugin figures it out automatically. You would only
# need to define these if your RIL does something unusual.
#
# No default
#
#remoteHangupReasons=20
#localHangupReasons=23

# Voice call support. Some devices like USB modems and tablets don't support
# voice calls. By default, voice calls are enabled and this option allows you
# to disable voice call handling.
#
# Default true
#
#enableVoicecall=true

# Support for Cell Broadcast System (CBS). By default, its enabled but if
# your rild and/or modem is not happy about it, you can turn it off.
#
# Default true
#
#enableCellBroadcast=true

# Timeout for the modem to show up, in milliseconds. Those that don't
# show up before this timeout expires, will be dropped (ignored).
#
# In some fairly rare cases it makes sense to shorten this timeout for
# optional modems (which may or may not be available), to speed up the
# boot up process.
#
# The default is 20000 (20 seconds)
#
#startTimeout=20000

# This allows to use deprecated RIL_REQUEST_GET_IMEI instead of
# RIL_REQUEST_DEVICE_IDENTITY to query IMEI from the modem. Some
# RILs (e.g. MTK) still don't understand RIL_REQUEST_DEVICE_IDENTITY.
#
# Default is false (use RIL_REQUEST_DEVICE_IDENTITY)
#
#legacyImeiQuery=false

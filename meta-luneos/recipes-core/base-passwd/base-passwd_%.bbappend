# This would work:
# SRC_URI:remove = "file://0002-Use-bin-sh-instead-of-bin-bash-for-the-root-user.patch"
# but then we would need to provide own version of 0003-Remove-for-root-since-we-do-not-have-an-etc-shadow.patch
# as the one in oe-core expects 0002-Use-bin-sh-instead-of-bin-bash-for-the-root-user.patch to be already
# applied on the same line, do_configure:prepend to use bash is simpler

do_configure:prepend() {
    # Undo 0002-Use-bin-sh-instead-of-bin-bash-for-the-root-user.patch
    sed -i 's%^\(root:.*\):/bin/sh%\1:/bin/bash%g' ${S}/passwd.master

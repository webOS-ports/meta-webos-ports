Subject: [PATCH] client: Exit on a fatal connection error

Terminate a client if there is an error such as EPIPE or ECONNRESET.
This is a safe method for a client that does not handle a fatal
connection error properly, but not recommended for the upstream as
ideally a client should be able to decide what to do on a broken
connection.

SUMMARY = "Wayland, a protocol between a compositor and clients"
DESCRIPTION = "Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients \
as well as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be \
a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev \
input devices, an X application, or a wayland client itself. The clients can \
be traditional applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other \
display servers."
